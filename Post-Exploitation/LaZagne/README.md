__The LaZagne Project !!!__

Description
----
The __LaZagne project__ is an open source application used to __retrieve lots of passwords__ stored on a local computer. 
Each software stores its passwords using different techniques (plaintext, APIs, custom algorithms, databases, etc.). This tool has been developed for the purpose of finding these passwords for the most commonly-used software.

This project has been added to [pupy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy/) as a post-exploitation module. Python code will be interpreted in memory without touching the disk and it works on Windows and Linux host. The last Linux release is not up to date so I recommend using pupy to use it. 

Standalones
----
Standalones are now available here: https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/

Usage
----
* Retrieve version
```
laZagne.exe --version
```

* Launch all modules
```
laZagne.exe all
```

* Launch only a specific module
```
laZagne.exe browsers
```

* Launch only a specific software script
```
laZagne.exe browsers -f (for Firefox)
```

* Write all passwords found into a file (-oN for Normal txt, -oJ for Json, -oA for All)
```
laZagne.exe all -oN
```

* Get help
```
laZagne.exe -h
laZagne.exe browsers -h
```

* Use a file for dictionary attacks (used only when it's necessary: Mozilla Master Password, system hashes, etc.). The file has to be a wordlist in cleartext (no rainbow), it has not been optimized to be fast but could be useful for basic passwords.
```
laZagne.exe all -path file.txt
```

* Change verbosity mode (2 different levels)
```
laZagne.exe all -vv
```

* Quiet mode (nothing will be printed on the standard output)
```
laZagne.exe all -quiet -oA
```

* Retrieve passwords on another drive (default: C) 
```
laZagne.exe all -drive D
```

__Note: For wifi passwords \ Windows Secrets, launch it with administrator privileges (UAC Authentication / sudo)__

Mac Os
----
__Note: In Mac OS System, without the user password it is very difficult to retrieve passwords stored on the computer.__ 
So, I recommend using one of these options

* If you know the user password, add it in the command line 
```
laZagne all --password SuperSecurePassword
```
* You could use the interactive mode that will prompt a dialog box to the user until the password will be correct 
```
laZagne all -i
```

Supported software
